# Sachet Knight

**Sachet Knight** is our first game, developed as a school project during our fourth year of high school. The development team consists of myself and two classmates. We used **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript** to create this game.

### Game Description

In **Sachet Knight**, you take on the role of a knight trapped in a mysterious castle. Your goal is to find the exit as quickly as possible. Despite its brevity, the game offers an engaging challenge that can be completed in under a minute.

### How to Start the Game

To start the game, open the `Intro.html` file or simply use the link in the **Sachet Knight** folder.

### Contributions and Improvements

If you wish to make improvements to the game, you are welcome to do so. However, we ask that you do not modify the original project.
